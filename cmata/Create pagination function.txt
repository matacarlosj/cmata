Create a endpoint that accepts numbers as an attribute and can limit the number of records. The functionality should accept a number and retrieve first n records (e.g., providing number `15` I should receive 15 first records from API).

To create an endpoint that limits the number of records retrieved from the API, you can follow these steps:

Update the CountriesController to include a new action for limiting the number of records:
csharp
Copy code
[HttpGet("limit")]
public async Task<IActionResult> LimitCountries([FromQuery] int recordLimit)
{
    if (recordLimit <= 0)
    {
        return BadRequest("Record limit must be a positive number.");
    }

    var countries = await _countryService.GetCountriesAsync();
    var limitedCountries = countries.Take(recordLimit).ToList();

    return Ok(limitedCountries);
}
Add a new route for the limiting action in your Startup.cs:
csharp
Copy code
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "limit",
    pattern: "api/countries/limit",
    defaults: new { controller = "Countries", action = "LimitCountries" }
);
Now, you can access the limited number of records by making a GET request to /api/countries/limit?recordLimit=YOUR_LIMIT_NUMBER. The recordLimit parameter specifies the maximum number of records you want to retrieve from the API.
For example, by providing a value of 15, you will receive the first 15 records from the API.
