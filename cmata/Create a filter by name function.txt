using https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all response in a .NET 6 endpoint create a filter by country name function: Create a function that accepts a string as a parameter and can filter by country `name/common`.   The filter should search for countries names that contains string from attributes (e.g. providing `st` as attribute I could find `Estonia`, providing `Sp` I could find `Spain`). Search should be case insensitive (e.g., providing `sT` should find `Estonia`).

To create a .NET 6 endpoint that filters countries by name from the https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all API response, you can follow these steps:

Create a new ASP.NET Core 6 Web API project in Visual Studio or your preferred development environment.

Install the System.Net.Http.Json NuGet package to make HTTP requests and parse JSON responses.

Create a model class to represent the country data. This class should match the structure of the JSON response from the API. You can use attributes like [JsonPropertyName] to map the class properties to JSON fields.

Here's an example of a Country class:

csharp
Copy code
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

public class Country
{
    [JsonPropertyName("name")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [JsonPropertyName("common")]
    public string CommonName { get; set; }
}
Create a service to fetch data from the API and filter by country name. You can use HttpClient to make the API request and then filter the results based on the provided search string.
csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class CountryService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public CountryService(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(httpClient));
    }

    public async Task<List<Country>> GetCountriesAsync()
    {
        var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all");
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

        using var responseStream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();
        var countries = await JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync<List<Country>>(responseStream);

        return countries;
    }

    public async Task<List<Country>> FilterCountriesByNameAsync(string search)
    {
        var countries = await GetCountriesAsync();

        return countries
            .Where(c => c.Name.Contains(search, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) || c.CommonName.Contains(search, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
            .ToList();
    }
}
Create an API controller to expose the filtering functionality.
csharp
Copy code
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class CountriesController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly CountryService _countryService;

    public CountriesController(CountryService countryService)
    {
        _countryService = countryService;
    }

    [HttpGet("filter")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> FilterCountriesByName([FromQuery] string search)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(search))
        {
            return BadRequest("Search query is required.");
        }

        var filteredCountries = await _countryService.FilterCountriesByNameAsync(search);

        return Ok(filteredCountries);
    }
}
Configure the HttpClient and register the CountryService in your Startup.cs:
csharp
Copy code
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ...

    services.AddHttpClient<CountryService>();

    // ...
}
Run your ASP.NET Core 6 application, and you can access the filtered countries by making a GET request to /api/countries/filter?search=YOUR_SEARCH_STRING.
This setup allows you to filter countries by their names (including common names) in a case-insensitive manner.

everything is ok except the country model, name is an object that contains a common property
ChatGPT
If the name property is an object containing a common property in the API response, you can modify the Country model accordingly. Here's how you can define the Country class to match the updated structure:

csharp
Copy code
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

public class Country
{
    [JsonPropertyName("name")]
    public Name Name { get; set; }
}

public class Name
{
    [JsonPropertyName("common")]
    public string Common { get; set; }
}
With this modified model, the Name property contains an object with the Common property representing the common name of the country.

You can then update the CountryService to filter countries by their common names:

csharp
Copy code
public async Task<List<Country>> FilterCountriesByNameAsync(string search)
{
    var countries = await GetCountriesAsync();

    return countries
        .Where(c => c.Name.Common.Contains(search, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
        .ToList();
}
Now, the FilterCountriesByNameAsync method filters countries by their common names as specified in the updated model.
